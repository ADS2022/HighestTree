[Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/)

What is a **Maven Repository**? A repository in Maven holds build artifacts and dependencies of varying types. In Maven
terminology, a repository is a directory where all the project jars, library jar, plugins or any other project specific
artifacts are stored and can be used by Maven easily. The *local* repository is a directory on the computer where Maven
runs. It caches remote downloads and contains temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released.
*Remote* repositories refer to any other type of repository. These repositories might be a truly remote repository set
up by a third party to provide their artifacts for downloading (for example, repo.maven.apache.org).
